Automated Dispersion Compensation Network in Python using Keras
===============================================================

Overview
------------
Chromatic dispersion compensation is a common problem that degrades the resolution in optical coherence tomography (OCT).
In this project we present a deep learning approach for dispersion compensation using a fully convolutional network (FCN)
named automated dispersion comepnsation network (ADC-Net).

Dataset
------------
The dataset were collected by the Biomedical Optics and Ophthalmic Imaging Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Dependencies
------------
- tensorflow >= 2.3.0
- keras >= 2.4.0
- python >= 3.8
